    "text": "1. Choices are possible\n\nSeems obvious, but sets us apart from many models from 19th century sociology\nBig discussions here. See Determined: a science of life without free will (Sapolsky, 2023)\nImportant link to theory of agency in biology\nWe usually model this through restrictions (see point 4 below)\n\n\n\n2. There is a defined subject that makes decisions, in some circumstance\n\n(Usually) It’s and individual, not a set of individuals such as family nor parts of an individual such as Id and Ego – but there has been much development in this direction.\nWe just need to separate individual from the whole society (or there would be no need to study interactions)\nThis is not the selfish agent assumption, which we can also make in particular settings\n\n\n\n3. Choices are made according to some criteria\n\nThey are not purely random (at least not necessarily)\nThis is the same as saying as there is some objective. Could be anything: profit, utility, leisure, stability, time with loved ones, watching as many world cup matches as possible…\n\n\n\n4. Choices are subject to constraints\n\nOne cannot simply choose ‘everything’. At the very least there is the opportunity cost of time.\nThis is not necessarily a budget restriction: could be time, attention, memory, information, ability to process information, or external factors such as physical environment or laws, or simply other agents.\nIn this course, we will consider a budget constraint, but this is just a particular case, and the absent restrictions are as important as the one(s) we will consider!\n\n\n\n5. Consistency requirement: equilibrium\n\nEveryone is choosing according to the four previous assumptions at any point in time.\nIn other words: given the criteria and the restrictions at some point in time, no one would like to change their decision at that moment.\nFor a given individual, part of the environment is ‘other individuals making choices, and maybe they’re even taking my actions into account’\nThis is NOT about absence of movement or change. There could be mistakes and regrets.\n\nWe typically write the first four points as\n\n“Choose x to solve \\max u(x) subject to restrictions on x”\n\nThen we move on to interaction: no individual incentive to deviate, given what others are doing.\nIn short, our structure is optimization + equilibrium.\n\nThis is very general. Hard to work without it.",

    "section": "1.2 About assumptions",
    "text": "1.2 About assumptions\nWe’ve barely begun and already have some big assumptions.\nWe’ll make many other assumptions along the way.\n\nPay attention to them: assumptions must be clearly understood.\nWe usually write A \\Rightarrow B: we must be able to understand what happens (B) under some circunstances (A).\nThis is NOT them same as stating B (think of the first welfare theorem).\n\nAssumptions have a tradeoff.\n\nOn one hand, they take away generality: if we assume economic agents have perfect memory, we must be cautious when applying our model to agents without perfect memory.\nOn the other hand, they allow us to better understand a (more restricted) setting.\n\nThis is the tradeoff of the lab rat.\n\nIt’s easier to study, and we learn a lot from it, but must be aware of its limits.\nIn our case, ‘homo economicus’, for example: Simplest economic model: maximize utility subject only to a budget constraint.\nWe study the homo economicus hoping to learn something about its distant cousin: homo sapiens.\nThe more realist economic agent from behavioral economics is our ‘lab monkey’: the same tradeoff applies.\n\nIs there a way around this tradeoff?\n\nNo: it comes from our own limitations, as we cannot pay attention and process all available information.\nThink for a moment far from economics: zebras and lions. Where are their eyes placed?\nThey “choose” to focus on some specific type of information, and give up on many things.\nIt works according to some specific criterion: survival.\n\nIn economics (and any other field of science), we will make assumptions, whether it’s clear or not. The problem is the criterion we use to evaluate them. No “given” criterion such as survival. Major discussion about criteria, for every research question.\nWe may put it another way: there is a tradeoff to realism. If it’s too much: can’t really understand what’s going on, can’t make predictions. Borges’ map. If it’s too little: you’ll understand clearly something not relevant to your research question. Drunkard looking for his keys under the lamp post, not where he lost them.\nIn the end of the day, we use approximations, and we want predictions that can be tested to see whether these approximations are good enough. Keep in mind that external validity is always an issue, even when we have good empirical results, and this depends on how restrictive our assumptions are (must be extra careful with observational data!).\nLastly, a point about representation: a model of reality is different from reality. Implication: solving a model in decision theory is different from actually making that decision (same reasoning holds for anything else in science). Think of catching an object thrown to you (no actual functional analysis problem) or buying stuff at the grocery store (no actual lagrangian).\nThis goes back to theory of agency in biology: consciousness, representation and abstraction. Important: if the modeler knows more than the agents in the model, this must be modeled too! It’s some form of restriction.\nAs for criticism: when we criticize a model, we either say “A is not the relevant setup to consider” or “A does not really imply B”. Considering a different setup (A' instead of A) is not really a criticism – it’s just ‘doing something else’. Think of political and relief maps, or flat maps and globes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe always have to ask: What are we building our models and theories for? What do we want to understand?\nModels are made to be used, not to be believed\nIf they help us with something relevant, they’re doing their job: increase food production, cure a disease, decrease unemployment, etc.\n\n\n\n\nMathematics\nOur assumptions often generate a setup that may be analyzed mathematically. Our optimization problem will be written as something similar to:\n\\max_{\\{x\\}} {f(x)} subject to some restriction\ng(x) &lt; 0\nYet, it is important to notice the difference between language and tools. We use mathematical language as in the example above. This does not mean we’re using any mathematical tools yet: this could be written in plain English. Often we will use actual mathematical tools: if f and g are differentiable functions, then we may use first-order conditions.\n\n\nAn additional point\n\nAs science advances, it becomes more continuous, and less discrete.\nIn economics, we fight too often over petty details (Freud: narcissism of small differences.)\n\nWe will start with the most basic model: the traditional homo economicus, our lab rat, whose only restriction is budgetary.\n\n\nAn example\nLionel Page fascinating explanation of Prospect Theory:\n\n\n\nProspect Theory\n\n\nThis is the most cited paper in economics: people value what they have by considering it as a gain or a loss relative to a subjective “reference point”. This point may be status quo, expectations, aspirations: not defined / agreed upon.\nReference dependent preferences are a cognitive flaw? The biological basis of economic behavior (Robson, 2001): subjective satisfaction can be seen as an informative signal that helps us identify the best option. Eating, sleeping and having sex ‘feel good’ because they help us survive: subjective satisfaction is informative signal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut brain (neurological processes, more generally) have constraints when generating signals of satisfaction:\n\nSignals must be bounded because there is a limited number of neurons to process them\nSignals are not perfectly precise (drugs as hijacking)\n\nHence: we are more likely to make mistakes when options are close.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan your system of perception be improved to reduce mistakes?\nYes. When the slope of subjective satisfaction increases, it reduces mistakes between options that are close.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut satisfaction is bounded: physical limit to pleasure (that is, to informativeness of signals). Then satisfaction cannot have a super high slope everywhere.\nThe question becomes: Where should the slope of subjective satisfaction be steeper to limit mistakes? The optimal solution is that it should be steeper where you are more likely to face options to choose from!\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also Rayo and Becker (2007) and Netzer (2009).\n\nSupport from neuroscience: sensory systems respond to stimuli by following their distribution.\nReference-dependent preferences are not a cognitive flaw. “They are an optimal solution, under irreducible biological constraints faced by our perceptual systems.” \\rightarrow Efficient coding.\nReference point is an expectation.\nRecent literature in economics and neuroscience.\n\nIn short: again, we have the problem “Choose x to solve \\max u(x) subject to restrictions on x”. Restrictions that don’t show up are as relevant as those that show up.\nFar from the only example… in fact, hard to think of economics without this structure (and hard in social sciences in general). What decisions are automatic, and what are well-thought? (Do you think about where to brush your teeth every day?)\n\n\nSome difficult words\nThis setup is an approach based on optimization and equilibrium. Sometimes we talk about rational agents. All these words have multiple meanings and lead to confusion.\n\nOptimization simply means that individuals make choices according to some criteria, given the relevant restrictions. But sometimes used as ‘perfect optimization’ or ‘hyper rationality’, which needs not be the case.\nRationality has different uses within microeconomics. First: similar to optimization under restrictions. Second: a particular set of basic assumptions on the decision-maker. We will use the latter. Sometimes (very often!) used in the sense of ‘super computational power’. This is usually the case in basic microeconomics: we only have a budget constraint, meaning there are no cognitive constraints. This is often referred to as ‘homo economicus’ of ‘homo rationalis’ and is simply our lab rat: we study it not because it’s realistic, but because it’s much easier to study, and many things we learn carry over to ‘actual’ humans.\nEquilibrium means there is no unilateral incentive to change in a given context. Sometimes used, even within economics, in the sense of physics: lack of movement, or some very stable movement. This is NOT the meaning of the word in microeconomics.",

Hedonic Interpretation\nUtility is an objective measure of individual’s well-being.\n\nNature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do… By the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever according to the tendency it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in other words to promote or to oppose that happiness. I say of every action whatsoever, and therefore not only of every action of a private individual, but of every measure of government.\nJeremy Bentham\n\n“u (apple) = 7, u (banana) = 12” \\rightarrow apple gives 7 units of pleasure, banana gives 12 units of pleasure. This is not the standard way economists think about utility.\n\n\nWhat do Utility Levels Mean?

This is Exercise 1C1 (MWG).\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamental Theorem of Revealed Preference Theory\n\nTheorem 1.1 If choice data (\\mathscr{B}, C) satisfies WARP and includes all subsets of X of up to 3 elements, then \\succcurlyeq^* is rational and rationalizes the data: that is, C^* (B, \\succcurlyeq^*) = C(B). Furthermore, this is the only preference relation that rationalizes the data (MWG Proposition 1.D.2). Conversely, if the choice data violates WARP, then it cannot be rationalized by any rational preference relation. (MWG Proposition 1D1).\n\nFor the first part: Remember \\mathscr{B} is a set of sets: this condition states that it must include all sets of up to three elements. Check MWG example 1D1 to see that we cannot drop this assumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\nLet’s prove the first part.\n\nWe need to show that:\n\n\\succcurlyeq^* is rational;\nC^* (B, \\succcurlyeq^*) = C(B);\n\\succcurlyeq^* is the only preference relation that satisfies ii.\n\nFor item (i), we must show that \\succcurlyeq* is complete and transitive.\nComplete. Take some \\{x,y\\} \\in \\mathscr{B}. This holds because \\{x,y\\} has only two elements. Then either x \\in C({x,y}) or y \\in C(\\{x,y\\}) (or both). In the first case, x \\succcurlyeq^* y. In the second case, y \\succcurlyeq^* x. Hence \\succcurlyeq^* is complete.\nTransitive. Take x \\succcurlyeq^* y and y \\succcurlyeq^* z. Consider \\{x,y,z\\ \\in \\mathscr{B}\\} (again, it has no more than three elements, so it belongs to \\mathscr{B}). We have to show that x \\in C(\\{x,y,z\\}) because this implies x \\succcurlyeq^* y: transitivity.\nWe know that C(\\{x,y,z\\}) \\neq \\varnothing.\n\nIf y \\in C(\\{x,y,z\\}): since x \\succcurlyeq^* y, the weak axiom yields x \\in C(\\{x,y,z\\}).\nIf z \\in C(\\{x,y,z\\}): since y \\succcurlyeq^* z, the weak axiom yields y \\in C(\\{x,y,z\\}), and from the previous line we have x \\in C(\\{x,y,z\\}). In any case, x \\in C(\\{x,y,z\\}), as we wanted to show.\n\nThis concludes the proof of item (i).\nFor item (ii), we proceed in two steps.\nFirst: suppose x \\in C(B). Then x \\succcurlyeq^* y for all y \\in B. Hence x \\in C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq^*). In short: every element x that belongs to C(B) also belongs to C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq^*). In other words, C(B) \\subset C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq^*).\nSecond: suppose now x \\in C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq^*).\nThen x \\succcurlyeq^* y for all y \\in B, as above.\nHence for each y \\in B, there exists some B_y \\in \\mathscr{B} such that x,y \\in B_y and x \\in C(B_y): at the very least, one may choose B_y = \\{x,y\\}, which has only two elements and therefore belongs to \\mathscr{B}.\nSince C(B) \\neq \\varnothing, the weak axiom implies x \\in C(B), by the same reasoning as in part i: whatever y may belong to C(B), it cannot be revealed as preferred to x because x \\in C(B_y) and hence x \\in C(B).\nIn short: x \\in C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq^*) \\implies x \\in C(B), or C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq^*) \\subset C(B).\nTaking these two steps together, we conclude that C(B) = C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq^*), finishing the proof of item ii.\nFor item (iii), remember that \\mathscr{B} includes all two-element subsets of X. Hence the choice structure C(\\quad) determines the pairwise preference over X of any rationalizing preference.\nQED.\n\nThe second part may be written as: if preferences are rational, then choice data (\\mathscr{B},C) satisfies WARP. Let’s prove this.\n\nConsider B \\in \\mathscr{B} such that x, y \\in B, and x \\in C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq). Then x \\succcurlyeq y. (“x is weakly revealed preferred to y”)\nConsider B' \\in \\mathscr{B} such that x, y \\in B', and y \\in C^*(B',\\succcurlyeq). Then y \\succcurlyeq z for all z \\in B'.\nTransitivity then implies x \\succcurlyeq z for all z \\in B'.\nBut this is the same as saying x \\in C^*(B',\\succcurlyeq).\nThat is, we cannot find any B' such that y \\succ x. (“y) cannot be strictly revealed preferred to x”). Hence, WARP is satisfied.\nQED.\n\n\nTheorem tells us how individual’s choices reveal her preferences: as long as choices satisfy WARP, can interpret choices as resulting from maximizing a rational preference relation.\nWe may conclude that if \\mathscr{B} includes all subsets of X, then choice and preferences work together just fine. But this is too restrictive: think of budget sets.\nWe use then the Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference, a “recursive closure” of the weak axiom. If x is directly or indirectly revealed preferred to y, then y cannot be directly revealed preferred to x. The Strong Axiom is more restrictive in general than the Weak Axiom (but they are equivalent for two goods). The Strong Axiom is a necessary and sufficient condition for choices to be generated by rational preferences.\n\nQuestion: choices usually follow WARP?\nYes – even more than that. Bedi and Burghart (2018):\n\n“Choices made under the influence of THC, MDMA, and placebo were all GARP compliant. Thus, even when participants were acutely intoxicated with THC or MDMA, their choices remained consistent with the tenets of neoclassical choice theory.”\n\nGARP is the Strong Axiom that allows for non-unique optimal choices.\n\n\n\nPreference and Utility\nNow that know how to infer preferences from choice, next step is representing preferences with a utility function.\n\nDefinition 1.4 A utility function u : X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} represents preference relation \\succcurlyeq if, for all x,y, x \\succcurlyeq y \\iff u(x) \\geq u(y)\n\nbanana \\succcurlyeq apple is represented by both:\nu(apple) = 7, \\quad u(banana) = 12 u(apple) = 2, \\quad u(banana) = 15\nIf u represents \\succcurlyeq, so does any strictly increasing transformation of u.\nRepresenting a given preference relation is an ordinal property. The numerical values of utility are cardinal properties.\n\nWhat Preferences have a Utility Representation?\n\nTheorem 1.2 Only rational preferences relations can be represented by a utility function (MWG Proposition 1B2). Conversely, if X is finite, any rational preference relation can be represented by a utility function (MWG exercise 1B5 - ‘X finite’ is only one possibility).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\nLet’s prove the first part.\n\nWe may write it as: \\succcurlyeq is represented by utility function implies \\succcurlyeq is rational.\nTo show it’s rational, we have to show \\succcurlyeq are complete and transitive.\nLet’s show first \\succcurlyeq are complete. Consider x,y \\in X.\nu(.) \\in \\mathbb{R} implies that necessarily either u(x) \\geq u(y) or u(y) \\geq u(x). In the first case, by definition of u, we have x \\succcurlyeq y. Analogously, in the second case we have y \\succcurlyeq x. Hence \\succcurlyeq is complete.\nLet’s show now \\succcurlyeq are transitive. Take x,y,z \\in X such that x \\succcurlyeq y and y \\succcurlyeq z. We have to show that x \\succcurlyeq z.\nBy definition of u(.), it follows that u(x) \\geq u(y) and u(y) \\geq u(z). It then follows from the structure of the real numbers that u(x) \\geq u(z). Again, use the definition of u(.) to conclude that x \\succcurlyeq z. This is what we wanted to show, concluding the proof.\nQED.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Goes Wrong with Infinitely Many Alternatives?\nLexicographic preferences: dictionary system – e.g., “I’m not going by plane”.\n\nX = [0,1] \\times [0,1]\n\n(x_1, x_2) \\succcurlyeq (y_1, y_2) if either\n\nx_1 &gt; y_1 or\nx_1 = y_1 and x_1 \\geq y_2\n\nMaximize first component. In case of tie, maximize second component.\n\nTheorem 1.3 Lexicographic preferences cannot be represented by a utility function.\n\nThis is on MWG page 46.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\nLet’s prove this by contradiction. Assume there is a utility function representing the lexicographic preferences \\succcurlyeq.\nFix some x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}. Then:\n\nu(x_1, 2) &gt; u(x_1, 1)\n\nBoth u(x_1, 2) and u(x_1, 1) are real number. We will use the following mathematical result: we can find a rational number between any two real numbers.\nLet’s call this rational number r(x_1):\n\nu(x_1, 2) &gt; r(x_1) &gt; u(x_1, 1)\n\nNotice now that if x_1 &gt; x^{'}_{1}, then r(x_1) &gt; u(x_1, 1) &gt; u(x^{'}_{1},2) &gt; r(x^{'}_{1}).\nIn short, x_1 &gt; x^{'}_{1} \\implies r(x_1) &gt; r(x^{'}_{1}).\nThis means that r(.) is a strictly increasing function, and hence it is a bijection from \\mathbb{R} to \\mathbb{Q}.\nBut this is not possible.\nQED.\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Preferences\nWhat if rule out discontinuous preferences?\n\nDefinition 1.5 For X \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n, preference relation \\succcurlyeq is continuous if whenever x^m \\rightarrow x, y^m \\rightarrow y, and x^m \\succcurlyeq y^m for all m, we have x \\succcurlyeq y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\nLexicographic preferences are not continuous: see example 3C1 cont.\nLet’s show this. Consider two sequences of bundles:\n\nx_n = \\left(\\frac{1}{n},0\\right)\n \ny_n = (0,1)\n\nFor any n we choose, we have 1/n &gt; 0, and hence x_n \\succ y_n. But lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}{x_n} = (0,0) \\prec (0,1) = lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}{y_n}\nThat is, preference reverts in the limit: continuity does not hold, and hence \\succcurlyeq are not continuous.\nQED.\n\n\n\nTheorem 1.4 For X \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n, any continuous, rational preference relation can be represented by a (continuous) utility function.\n\nThis is MWG Proposition 3.C.1 – a bit advanced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\nThe general proof is difficult. Let’s show a sketch, assuming additionally that preferences are monotone.\nConsider only two goods (this is without loss of generality). For any \\alpha \\geq 0, define the bundle (\\alpha, \\alpha).\nPick some x = (x_1,x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2_+. Notice that monotonicity implies x \\succcurlyeq (0,0).\nNotice also that if \\left(\\overline{\\alpha}, \\overline{\\alpha}\\right) \\gg (x_1, x_2), then monotonicity implies \\left(\\overline{\\alpha}, \\overline{\\alpha}\\right) &gt; (x_1, x_2).\nOne may show that there is only one value of \\alpha \\in [0,\\overline{\\alpha}] such that indifference holds.\nWe will call it \\alpha(x):\n\n\\left(\\alpha(x),\\alpha(x)\\right) \\sim (x_1,x_2)\n Take u(x) = \\alpha(x). This is our utility function.\nQED.\n\n\nNotice that this is very general. Assumptions are not very restrictive (not even X \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n).\n\n\nReview of Revealed Preference Theory\n\nIf choice data satisfies WARP, can interpret as resulting from maximizing a rational preference relation.\nIf set of alternatives is finite or preferences are continuous, can represent these preferences with a utility function.\nUtility function is just a convenient mathematical representation of individual’s ordinal preferences.\nUtility may or may not be correlated with pleasure/avoidance of pain.",

We have to show that S(x) is convex. To do so, take any two elements y, y' \\in S(x).\nBy definition of S(x), y, y' \\in S(x) means that y \\succcurlyeq x and y' \\succcurlyeq x\nConvexity then implies that for all \\alpha \\in [0,1], \\alpha y + (1-\\alpha)y' \\succcurlyeq x.\nBut this implies that \\alpha y + (1-\\alpha)y' \\in U(x).\nIn short: we showed that y, y' \\in S(x) \\Rightarrow \\alpha y + (1-\\alpha)y' \\in U(x) for all \\alpha \\in [0,1].\nThis means that S(x) is convex.\nProof of necessity (\\Leftarrow):\nWe will prove by contradiction. Assume S(x) is convex, but \\succcurlyeq is not convex. We have to find an absurd conclusion.\nAssume \\succcurlyeq is not convex. Then there are \\alpha \\in (0,1), y, y' and x such that y \\succcurlyeq x, y' \\succcurlyeq x but x \\succ \\alpha y + (1-\\alpha)y'. This implies that S(x) is not convex.\nIn short: we showed that if \\succcurlyeq is not convex, then S(x) is not convex for some x. This is equivalent to showing that S(x) \\Rightarrow \\succcurlyeq convex.\n\nQED.\n\n\nThat’s why convex preferences are called convex: for every x, the set of all alternatives preferred to x is convex. When the context is clear, we will write simply S instead of S(x), and interpret it as the set of alternatives preferred to some unspecified x.\n\n\nSet of Maximizers\n\nTheorem 2.3 \\quad If \\succcurlyeq is convex, then for any convex choice set B, the set C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq) is convex. If \\succcurlyeq is convex, then for any convex choice set B, the set C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq) is single-valued (for empty).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\nFirst part:\nTake any x \\in B\nIf y,y'\\in C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq), then y \\succcurlyeq x and y' \\succcurlyeq x.\nConvexity then implies that for all \\alpha \\in [0,1], \\alpha y + (1-\\alpha)y' \\succcurlyeq x.\nSince this holds for any x \\in B, it follows that \\alpha \\in [0,1], \\alpha y + (1-\\alpha)y' \\in C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq).\nThat is, C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq) is convex.\nSecond part:\nAssume there are x, x' \\in C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq) with x \\neq x'.\nThen x \\succcurlyeq x and x' \\succcurlyeq x: definition of optimal choices.\nStrict convexity then implies that for all \\alpha \\in [0,1], one has \\alpha x +(1-\\alpha)x' \\succ x.\nBut the first part of the theorem implies \\alpha x +(1-\\alpha)x' \\in C^*(B,\\succcurlyeq).\n\nIn words: if there are two different optimal choices with strictly convex preferences, then it is possible to find an alternative that is strictly better than at least one of them. This is absurd as the DM should have chosen this alternative.\nQED.\n\n\n\n\nConvexity: Utility Functions\nThe characteristic of utility functions that represent convex preferences is quasi-concavity.\n\nDefinition 2.4 A function u:X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} is quasi-concave if, for every x,y with u(x) \\geq u(y) and every \\alpha \\in (0,1),\n\nu(\\alpha x + (1-\\alpha)y) \\geq u(y)\n A function u:X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} is strictly quasi-concave if, for every x,y with u(x) \\geq u(y), x \\neq y and every \\alpha \\in (0,1),\n\nu(\\alpha x + (1-\\alpha)y) &gt; u(y)\n\n\n\nTheorem 2.4 \\quad u is quasi-concave \\iff for every r \\in \\mathbb{R} the upper contour set S = \\{x \\in X: u(x) \\geq r\\} is convex.\n\nNotation: this is the same set of ‘preferred alternatives’ we used before. We may write S(x) if we want to highlight that these alternatives are preferred to some specific x. Analogously, we may write S(r) to highlight that these alternatives achieve a level of utility no lower than r. If the alternative x or the choice r are generic, we may write simply S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\nProof of sufficiency (\\Rightarrow):\n\nTake any r \\in \\mathbb{R}.\nTake two elements of S = \\{x \\in X: u(x) \\geq r\\}. That is, take x,x' such that u(x), u(x') \\geq r.\nAssume without loss of generality that u(x) \\geq u(x').\nThen:\n\nu(\\alpha x + (1-\\alpha)x') \\underbrace{\\geq}_{quasi-concavity} u(x') \\geq r\n This implies \\alpha x + (1-\\alpha)x' \\in \\{x \\in X: u(x) \\geq r\\}\nThis holds for any two elements in the upper contour set S = \\{x \\in X: u(x) \\geq r\\}, and any \\alpha \\in [0,1]. It follows that this set is convex.\n\nProof of necessity (\\Leftarrow):\n\nAssume there is some r \\in \\mathbb{R}, some \\alpha \\in (0,1) and x,x' \\in S = \\{x \\in X: u(x) \\geq r\\} such that:\n\n\\alpha x + (1-\\alpha)x' \\notin S = \\{x \\in X: u(x) \\geq r\\}\n That is, S is not convex. This meand that u(x) \\geq r, u(x') \\geq r but u(\\alpha x + (1-\\alpha)x') &lt; r, for some r \\in \\mathbb{R} and some \\alpha \\in (0,1).\nThis means that u is not quasi-concave.\nIn short, we showed that if S is not convex for all r \\in \\mathbb{R}, then u is not quasi-concave. This is equivalent to showing that if u is quasi-concave, then S is convex for all u.\nQED.\n\n\n\nTheorem 2.5 Suppose utility function u represents preferences \\succcurlyeq. Then:\nu quasi-concave \\iff \\succcurlyeq convex\nu strictly quasi-concave \\iff \\succcurlyeq strictly convex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nProve this theorem. Proof follows directly from Theorem 2.4.\n\n\nWarning: convex preferences are represented by quasi-concave utility functions. Convex preferences get that name because they make upper contour sets convex. Quasi-concave utility functions get that name because quasi-concavity is a weaker property than concavity.",

It uses the following notation: U\\left(\\sum \\alpha_{k} p_{k}\\right)= \\sum \\alpha_{k} U\\left(p_{k}\\right), just substituting p for L (which stands for ‘lottery’).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\nWithout loss of generality, we will assume only two consequences, c^{1} and c^{2}.\nHence any lottery p may be written as p=\\left(p^{1}, p^{2}\\right), in which p^{1}=\\operatorname{Prob}\\left(c^{1}\\right) and p^{2}=\\operatorname{Prob}\\left(c^{2}\\right).\nAll arguments below hold unchanged for p=\\left(p^{1}, \\ldots, p^{n}\\right), that is, for n consequences c^{1}, \\ldots, c^{n}. This extension is shown in red below; you may simply ignore it in your first reading.\nThe arguments below also hold for c \\in\\left[c^{1}, c^{n}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}, but the math is not exactly the same.\n\nNecessity: U linear in probabilities \\Rightarrow U has expected utility form\n\nWrite lottery p=\\left(p^{1}, p^{2}\\right) as a convex combination of degenerate lotteries \\left(C^{1}, C^{2}\\right) :\n\np=p^{1} C^{1}+p^{2} C^{2}+\\cdots+p^{n} C^{n}\n\nThat is, C^{1}=(1,0), meaning that consequence 1\\left(c^{1}\\right) happens with probability 1 , and C^{2}=(0,1), meaning that consequence 2\\left(c^{2}\\right) happens with probability 1 . The\\ equation above is simply p=\\left(p^{1}, p^{2}\\right)=\\left(p^{1}, 0\\right)+\\left(0, p^{2}\\right)=p^{1} \\cdot(1,0)+p^{2} \\cdot(0,1)= p^{1} C^{1}+p^{2} C^{2}.\nThen:\n\nU(p)=U\\left(p^{1} C^{1}+p^{2} C^{2}+\\cdots+p^{n} C^{n}\\right)=p^{1} U\\left(C^{1}\\right)+p^{2} U\\left(C^{2}\\right)+\\cdots+p^{n} U\\left(C^{n}\\right)\n\nThe second equality follows from our assumption: U is linear in probabilities.\nBut U\\left(C^{1}\\right) is the utility from a degenerate lottery, that is, it’s simply the vNM utility of consequence c_{1}: U\\left(C^{1}\\right)=u\\left(c^{1}\\right).\nRemember our notation: big U is for DM’s actual utility; small u is form DM’s vNM utility. Big C denotes a lottery; small c denotes a consequence.\nThe last equation may be rewritten as:\n\n\\begin{gathered}\nU(p)=U\\left(p^{1} C^{1}+p^{2} C^{2}+\\cdots+p^{n} C^{n}\\right)=p^{1} U\\left(C^{1}\\right)+p^{2} U\\left(C^{2}\\right)+\\cdots+p^{n} U\\left(C^{n}\\right) \\\\\n=p^{1} u\\left(c^{1}\\right)+p^{2} u\\left(c^{2}\\right)+\\cdots+p^{n} u\\left(c^{n}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n\nIn short:\n\nU(p)=p^{1} u\\left(c^{1}\\right)+p^{2} u\\left(c^{2}\\right)+\\cdots+p^{n} u\\left(c^{n}\\right)\n\nThis is exactly the expected utility property, concluding the proof.\n\nSufficiency: U has expected utility form \\Rightarrow U linear in probabilities\n\nConsider a compound lottery:\n\n\\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{k} ; \\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{k}\\right)\n\nNotice that now we have p_{1} instead of p^{1}; and p_{2} instead of p^{2}. Superscripts refer to consequences; subscripts refer to specific lotteries.\nThat is, p_{1} and p_{2} are different lotteries, and each one is a vector assigning probabilities for each of the two possible consequences c^{1} and c^{2} :\n\np_{i}=\\left(p_{i}^{1}, p_{i}^{2}, \\ldots, p_{i}^{n}\\right)\n\nFor i=1, \\ldots, k. That is, we have k lotteries, and each one is chosen with probability \\alpha_{i} in our compound lottery.\nWe will allow k to be generic. If you want, just take k=2 in the following computations - again, it’s without loss of generality, but be careful not to confuse the number of consequences with the number of lotteries.\nConsider now the following (reduced) lottery:\n\n\\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} p_{k}\n\nConsider the utility of this lottery:\n\nU\\left(\\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} p_{k}\\right)\n\nWe may now use our assumption: U has the expected utility form. That is, one may rewrite this utility as:\n\nU\\left(\\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} p_{k}\\right)=u^{1} \\cdot \\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{1}\\right)+u^{2} \\cdot \\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{2}\\right)+\\cdots+u^{n} \\cdot \\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{n}\\right)\n\nWhat are these u^{i} s? We just need to know that there are some u^{i} s that make this equation hold - our assumption guarantees this is the case. But we do have an interpretation for them: u^{i} is just the vNM utility of consequence c^{i}. Analogously, \\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{i}\\right) is simply the probability of this consequence, computed from the compound lottery \\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} p_{k}.\nThis explains why we have subscripts on the LHS, but superscripts on the RHS. In the LHS, we have lotteries (that generate a compound lottery). On the RHS, we have consequences with vNM utilities u^{1}, u^{2}, \\ldots, u^{n}. If you want, you may think of the lottery on the LHS as any given lottery p.\nLet’s develop this equation:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n& U\\left(\\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} p_{k}\\right)= \\\\\n& u^{1} \\cdot \\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{1}\\right)+u^{2} \\cdot \\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{2}\\right)= \\\\\n& u^{1} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left(\\alpha_{1} p_{1}^{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}^{1}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} p_{k}^{1}\\right)}_{\\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{1}\\right)}+u^{2} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left(\\alpha_{1} p_{1}^{2}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} p_{k}^{2}\\right)}_{\\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{2}\\right)}+\\cdots+u^{n} \\\\\n& \\underbrace{\\left(\\alpha_{1} p_{1}^{n}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}^{n}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} p_{k}^{n}\\right)}_{\\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{2}\\right)}= \\\\\n& \\alpha_{1} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left(u^{1} \\cdot p_{1}^{1}+u^{2} \\cdot p_{1}^{2}+\\cdots+u^{n} \\cdot p_{1}^{n}\\right)}_{U\\left(p_{1}\\right)}+\\alpha_{2} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left(u^{1} \\cdot p_{2}^{1}+u^{2} \\cdot p_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+u^{n} \\cdot p_{2}^{n}\\right)}_{U\\left(p_{2}\\right)}+\\cdots \\\\\n& +\\alpha_{k} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left(u^{1} \\cdot p_{k}^{1}+u^{2} \\cdot p_{k}^{2}+\\cdots+u^{n} \\cdot p_{k}^{n}\\right)}_{U\\left(p_{k}\\right)}= \\\\\n& \\alpha_{1} \\cdot U\\left(p_{1}\\right)+\\alpha_{2} \\cdot U\\left(p_{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} \\cdot U\\left(p_{k}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nFrom the second to the third line, we use the definition of \\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{1}\\right) : it is simply the first coordinate of the vector \\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} p_{k}, ie, the compound lottery. It is analogous for \\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{2}\\right) to \\operatorname{Prob}\\left(u^{n}\\right).\nFrom the third to the fourth line: we use again our assumption: U has the expected utility form. Hence we may write U\\left(p_{1}\\right)=u^{1} \\cdot p_{1}^{1}+u^{2} \\cdot p_{1}^{2}+\\cdots+u^{n} \\cdot p_{1}^{n}. It is analogous for U\\left(p_{2}\\right) to U\\left(p_{k}\\right).\nIn short:\n\nU\\left(\\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} p_{k}\\right)=\\alpha_{1} \\cdot U\\left(p_{1}\\right)+\\alpha_{2} \\cdot U\\left(p_{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\alpha_{k} \\cdot U\\left(p_{k}\\right)\n\nThat is, U is linear in probabilities, concluding the proof.\nQED.\n\n\n\n\nExpected utility form is preserved under positive affine transformations\n\nTheorem 5.5 U, \\widetilde{U} have expected utility form (and represent the same preferences) \\Leftrightarrow there are \\beta&gt;0, \\gamma such that for all p, \\widetilde{U}(p)=\\beta U(p)+\\gamma.\n\nThis is MWG proposition 6B2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\nChoose \\bar{p}, \\underline{p} such that for all lottery p, \\bar{p} \\succcurlyeq p \\succcurlyeq \\underline{p}.\nIf \\bar{p} \\sim \\underline{p}, then all utility functions are constant, and the result follows immediately. Assume now \\bar{p}&gt;\\underline{p}.\n\nSufficiency: If U has expected utility form, then \\widetilde{U}(p)=\\beta U(p)+\\gamma also has expected utility form.\n\nConsider a compound lottery \\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}. That is, we have two lotteries ( p_{1} and p_{2} ), and each is chosen with probability \\alpha_{1} and \\alpha_{2}, respectively.\nWithout loss of generality, we consider only two lotteries, but the argument is unchanged for k lotteries.\nCompute the utility of this compound lottery under \\widetilde{U} :\n\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\widetilde{U}\\left(\\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}\\right)= \\\\\n\\beta \\cdot U\\left(\\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}\\right)+\\gamma= \\\\\n\\beta \\cdot\\left[\\alpha_{1} U\\left(p_{1}\\right)+\\alpha_{2} U\\left(p_{2}\\right)\\right]+\\gamma= \\\\\n\\alpha_{1} \\beta \\cdot U\\left(p_{1}\\right)+\\alpha_{2} \\beta \\cdot U\\left(p_{2}\\right)+\\underbrace{\\left[\\alpha_{1} \\gamma+\\alpha_{2} \\gamma\\right]}_{=\\gamma}= \\\\\n\\alpha_{1} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left[\\beta \\cdot U\\left(p_{1}\\right)+\\gamma\\right]}_{\\widetilde{U}\\left(p_{1}\\right)}+\\alpha_{2} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left[\\beta \\cdot U\\left(p_{2}\\right)+\\gamma\\right]}_{\\widetilde{U}\\left(p_{2}\\right)}= \\\\\n\\alpha_{1} \\cdot \\widetilde{U}\\left(p_{1}\\right)+\\alpha_{2} \\cdot \\widetilde{U}\\left(p_{2}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n\nFrom the first to the second line: we use the definition \\widetilde{U}(p)=\\beta U(p)+\\gamma.\nFrom the second to the third line: we use the assumption that U has the expected utility form: hence, U\\left(\\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}\\right)=\\alpha_{1} U\\left(p_{1}\\right)+\\alpha_{2} U\\left(p_{2}\\right).\nFrom the third to the fourth line: we simply write \\gamma=\\alpha_{1} \\gamma+\\alpha_{2} \\gamma, which is true because \\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{2}=1 (it’s a probability distribution, so it must sum up to one).\nFrom the fourth to the fifth line: we factor out \\alpha_{1} and \\alpha_{2}.\nIn short:\n\n\\widetilde{U}\\left(\\alpha_{1} p_{1}+\\alpha_{2} p_{2}\\right)=\\alpha_{1} \\cdot \\widetilde{U}\\left(p_{1}\\right)+\\alpha_{2} \\cdot \\widetilde{U}\\left(p_{2}\\right)\n\nThat is, \\widetilde{U} has the expected utility form, as we wanted to show.\n\nNecessity: U and \\widetilde{U} have the expected utility form (and represent the same preferences) implies that for some \\beta&gt;0, \\gamma, one has \\widetilde{U}(p)=\\beta U(p)+\\gamma\n\nFix a lottery p.\nChoose \\lambda_{p} \\in[0,1] such that:\n\nU(p)=\\lambda_{p} \\cdot U(\\bar{p})+\\left(1-\\lambda_{p}\\right) \\cdot U(\\underline{p})\n\nThis equation has two implications.\nFirst implication: p \\sim \\lambda_{p} \\bar{p}+\\left(1-\\lambda_{p}\\right) \\underline{p}\nThis holds because we’re assuming U has the expected utility form. The previous theorem states that if this is the case, then U is linear in probabilities. Hence the RHS of this last equation may be rewritten as:\n\n\\lambda_{p} \\cdot U(\\bar{p})+\\left(1-\\lambda_{p}\\right) \\cdot U(\\underline{p})=U\\left(\\lambda_{p} \\cdot \\bar{p}+\\left(1-\\lambda_{p}\\right) \\cdot \\underline{p}\\right)\n\nHence U(p)=U\\left(\\lambda_{p} \\cdot \\bar{p}+\\left(1-\\lambda_{p}\\right) \\cdot \\underline{p}\\right). By definition of a utility function, the arguments on each side must be indifferent for the DM.\nSecond implication:\n\n\\lambda_{p}=\\frac{U(p)-U(\\underline{p})}{U(\\bar{p})-U(\\underline{p})}\n\nThis is just a rearrangement of the equation above.\nWe know that \\widetilde{U} is linear in probabilities (previous theorems) and represents the same preferences. Hence:\n\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\widetilde{U}(p)=\\lambda_{p} \\cdot \\widetilde{U}(\\bar{p})+\\left(1-\\lambda_{p}\\right) \\cdot \\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})= \\\\\n\\lambda_{p} \\cdot[\\widetilde{U}(\\bar{p})-\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})]+\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})= \\\\\n\\underbrace{\\left.\\frac{U(p)-U(\\underline{p})}{U(\\bar{p})-U(\\underline{p})}\\right)}_{\\lambda_{p}} \\cdot[\\widetilde{U}(\\bar{p})-\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})]+\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})\n\\end{gathered}\n\nIn short:\n\n\\widetilde{U}(p)=\\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{U(p)-U(\\underline{p})}{U(\\bar{p})-U(\\underline{p})}\\right)}_{\\lambda_{p}} \\cdot[\\widetilde{U}(\\bar{p})-\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})]+\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})\n\nIn this last expression, only U(p) depends on p. All other terms are parameters. Rearrange this expression to get the following:\n\n\\widetilde{U}(p)=\\left[\\frac{\\widetilde{U}(\\bar{p})-\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})}{U(\\bar{p})-U(\\underline{p})}\\right] \\cdot U(p)+\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})-U(\\underline{p}) \\cdot\\left[\\frac{\\widetilde{U}(\\bar{p})-\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})}{U(\\bar{p})-U(\\underline{p})}\\right]\n\nAgain: except U(p), everything in this expression is a parameter, built from functions ( U or \\widetilde{U} ) evaluated at specific arguments ( \\bar{p} or \\underline{p} ). We can label them as we want. Let’s choose:\n\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\beta=\\left[\\frac{\\widetilde{U}(\\bar{p})-\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})}{U(\\bar{p})-U(\\underline{p})}\\right] \\\\\n\\gamma=\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})-U(\\underline{p}) \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left[\\frac{\\widetilde{U}(\\bar{p})-\\widetilde{U}(\\underline{p})}{U(\\bar{p})-U(\\underline{p})}\\right]}_{\\beta}\n\\end{array}\n\nThen one has:\n\n\\widetilde{U}(p)=\\beta U(p)+\\gamma\n\nThis is what we wanted to show, concluding the proof.\nQED.\n\n\n\n\nExpected utility theorem\n\nTheorem 5.6 (Rational and continuous) Preferences may be represented by an utility function with the expected utility form if and only if it respects the axiom of independence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\nProof of Necessity: if \\succcurlyeq respect the axiom of independence, then it may be represented by a utility function with the expected utility form.\n\nAssume there are lotteries \\bar{p} and \\underline{p} such that for all p, one has \\bar{p} \\succcurlyeq p \\succcurlyeq \\underline{p}.\nIf \\bar{p} \\sim \\underline{p}, the result follows immediately: use a constant utility function.\nAssume from now on \\bar{p}&gt;\\underline{p}.\nStep 1\nTake \\alpha and \\beta such that 1&gt;\\beta&gt;\\alpha&gt;0.\nWrite:\n\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\bar{p}= \\\\\n\\beta \\bar{p}+(1-\\beta) \\bar{p}&gt; \\\\\n\\beta \\bar{p}+(1-\\beta) \\underline{p}= \\\\\n(\\beta-\\alpha) \\bar{p}+\\alpha \\bar{p}+(1-\\beta) \\underline{p}&gt; \\\\\n(\\beta-\\alpha) \\underline{p}+\\alpha \\bar{p}+(1-\\beta) \\underline{p}= \\\\\n\\alpha \\bar{p}+(1-\\alpha) \\underline{p}&gt; \\\\\n\\alpha \\underline{p}+(1-\\alpha) \\underline{p}= \\\\\n\\underline{p}\n\\end{gathered}\n\nFrom the first to the second line: \\bar{p} is the average of \\bar{p} and \\bar{p} !\nFrom the second to the third line: we apply the axiom of independence. Observe that we keep \\bar{p} in the first term of the sum, but substitute \\bar{p} for \\underline{p} in the second term. Since \\bar{p}&gt;\\underline{p}, the axiom of independence implies the strict preference.\nFrom the third to the fourth line: add and subtract \\alpha \\bar{p}.\nFrom the fourth to the fifth line: again, we just substitute \\bar{p} for \\underline{p} in one term of the sum, and leave the rest unchanged. The axiom of independence applies again.\nFrom the fifth to the sixth line: we cancel out \\beta \\underline{p}.\nFrom the sixth to the seventh line: we repeat the argument of the 2^{\\text {nd }} to 3^{\\text {rd }} line, in reverse order.\nFrom the seventh to the eighth line: we repeat the argument of the 1^{\\text {st }} to 2^{\\text {nd }} line, in reverse order.\nStep 2: for all p, there is only one \\lambda_{p} such that \\lambda_{p} \\bar{p}+\\left(1-\\lambda_{p}\\right) \\underline{p} \\sim p\nExistence follows from continuity. For any lottery p, define the sets:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\{\\lambda \\in[0,1]: \\lambda \\bar{p}+(1-\\lambda) \\underline{p} \\succcurlyeq p\\} \\\\\n& \\{\\lambda \\in[0,1]: \\lambda \\bar{p}+(1-\\lambda) \\underline{p} \\preccurlyeq p\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nContinuity and completeness of \\succcurlyeq imply that both sets are closed (why?). Moreover, any \\lambda belongs to at least one of these sets. Since both sets are non-empty and [0,1] is connected, there must by some \\lambda belonging to both (again: why?). Define it as \\lambda_{p}.\nUniqueness follows from the previous step. If we were to slightly increase the value of \\lambda_{p} (from \\alpha to \\beta in the notation of the previous step), we would get a new lottery strictly preferred to the DM, breaking indifference.\nStep 3: U(p)=\\lambda_{p} is a utility function that represents \\succcurlyeq\nConsider two lotteries p and q.\nFrom steps 1 and 2, we may write:\n\np \\succcurlyeq q \\Leftrightarrow \\lambda_{\\mathrm{p}} \\bar{p}+\\left(1-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{p}}\\right) \\underline{p} \\succcurlyeq \\lambda_{\\mathrm{q}} \\bar{p}+\\left(1-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{q}}\\right) \\underline{p} \\Leftrightarrow \\lambda_{\\mathrm{p}} \\succcurlyeq \\lambda_{\\mathrm{q}}\n\nThe first \\Leftrightarrow comes from step 2: use p \\sim \\lambda_{\\mathrm{p}} \\bar{p}+\\left(1-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{p}}\\right) \\underline{p}, and analogously q \\sim \\lambda_{\\mathrm{q}} \\bar{p}+ \\left(1-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{q}}\\right) \\underline{p}.\nThe second \\Leftrightarrow comes from step 1 , taking \\lambda_{\\mathrm{p}}=\\beta and \\lambda_{\\mathrm{q}}=\\alpha.\nIn short, p \\succcurlyeq q \\Leftrightarrow \\lambda_{\\mathrm{p}} \\succcurlyeq \\lambda_{\\mathrm{q}}. This is the definition of an utility function representing \\succcurlyeq.\nStep 4: U(p)=\\lambda_{p} has the expected utility form.\nWe have to show that for all \\alpha \\in[0,1], and for any lotteries p, p^{\\prime}, one has:\n\nU\\left[\\alpha p+(1-\\alpha) p^{\\prime}\\right]=\\alpha U(p)+(1-\\alpha) U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right)\n\nFrom step 2, we have:\n\n\\begin{gathered}\np \\sim \\lambda_{\\mathrm{p}} \\bar{p}+\\left(1-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{p}}\\right) \\underline{p} \\\\\np^{\\prime} \\sim \\lambda_{\\mathrm{p}^{\\prime}} \\bar{p}+\\left(1-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{p}^{\\prime}}\\right) \\underline{p}\n\\end{gathered}\n\nFrom step 3, we have : U(p)=\\lambda_{p}. These two relations become:\n\n\\begin{gathered}\np \\sim U(p) \\bar{p}+(1-U(p)) \\underline{p} \\\\\np^{\\prime} \\sim U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\bar{p}+\\left(1-U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) \\underline{p}\n\\end{gathered}\n\nTake a convex combination \\alpha p+(1-\\alpha) p^{\\prime}. Given the two relations above, we have:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.\\alpha p+(1-\\alpha) p^{\\prime} \\sim \\alpha[U(p) \\bar{p}+(1-U(p)) \\underline{p}]+(1-\\alpha)\\left[U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\bar{p}+\\left(1-U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) \\underline{p}\\right]\\right] \\text { Factor out } \\bar{p} \\text { and } \\underline{p} \\\\\n& \\sim\\left[\\alpha U(p)+(1-\\alpha) U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right)\\right] \\cdot \\bar{p}+\\left[\\alpha(1-U(p))+(1-\\alpha)\\left(1-U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\\right] \\cdot \\underline{p} \\\\\n& \\quad \\sim\\left[\\alpha U(p)+(1-\\alpha) U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right)\\right] \\cdot \\bar{p}+\\left[1-\\left(\\alpha U(p)+(1-\\alpha) U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\\right] \\cdot \\underline{p}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNotice now that the terms in red are the same. We may denote it by any letter - for example, \\lambda (without the subscript to distinguish it from both \\lambda_{p} and \\lambda_{p^{\\prime}} ): \\lambda= \\alpha U(p)+(1-\\alpha) U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right).\nThe last line becomes:\n\n\\lambda \\cdot \\bar{p}+[1-\\lambda] \\cdot \\underline{p}\n\nIn short, and without all the colors:\n\n\\alpha p+(1-\\alpha) p^{\\prime} \\sim \\lambda \\cdot \\bar{p}+[1-\\lambda] \\cdot \\underline{p}\n\nBut this is the very definition of \\lambda_{p} as defined in step 2 , only applied to \\alpha p+ (1-\\alpha) p^{\\prime}. (If you want, you may write \\lambda_{\\alpha p+(1-\\alpha) p^{\\prime}} instead of \\lambda.)\nOr, using step 4, we have the more intuitive notation \\lambda=U\\left[\\alpha p+(1-\\alpha) p^{\\prime}\\right].\nBut we just defined \\lambda=\\alpha U(p)+(1-\\alpha) U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right).\nSince these are the same \\lambda, one has:\n\nU\\left[\\alpha p+(1-\\alpha) p^{\\prime}\\right]=\\alpha U(p)+(1-\\alpha) U\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right)\n\nThat is, U has the expected utility property, concluding the proof.\nQED.",
