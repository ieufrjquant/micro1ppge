# Expected Utility Theory

Course so far introduced basic theory of choice and utility, extended to DM and producer theory.

Last topic extends in another direction: choice under uncertainty.

## Choice under Uncertainty

All choices made under some kind of uncertainty.

Sometimes useful to ignore uncertainty, focus on ultimate choices.

Other times, must model uncertainty explicitly.

Examples:

-   Insurance markets.
-   Financial markets.
-   Game theory.

### Overview

Impose extra assumptions on basic choice model of Lectures 1-2.

## Lottery

Rather than choosing outcome directly, decision-maker chooses uncertain prospect (or lottery).

A lottery is a probability distribution over outcomes.
:::

Leads to von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility model.

## Consequences and Lotteries

Two basic elements of expected utility theory: consequences (or outcomes) and lotteries.

### Consequences

Finite set $C$ of consequences.

Consequences are what the decision-maker ultimately cares about.

Example: "I have a car accident, my insurance company covers most of the costs, but I have to pay a $\$ 500$ deductible."

### Decision-maker (DM) does not choose consequences directly.

DM chooses a lottery, $p$.

Lotteries are probability distributions over consequences:

$p: C \rightarrow[0,1]$ with $\sum_{c \in C} p(c)=1$.

Set of all lotteries is denoted by $P$.

Example: "A gold-level health insurance plan, which covers all kinds of diseases, but has a $\$ 500$ deductible."

Makes sense because DM assumed to rank health insurance plans only insofar as lead to different probability distributions over consequences.

## Choice

Decision-maker makes choices from set of alternatives $X$.

What's set of alternatives here, $C$ or $P$ ?

Answer: $P$

### DM does not choose consequences directly, but instead chooses lotteries

Assume decision-maker has a rational preference relation $\gtrsim$ on $P$.

Natural to assume this?

### Convex Combinations of Lotteries

Given two lotteries $p$ and $p^{\prime}$, the convex combination $\alpha p+(1-\alpha) p^{\prime}$ is the lottery defined by

$$
\left(\alpha p+(1-\alpha) p^{\prime}\right)(c)=\alpha p(c)+(1-\alpha) p^{\prime}(c) \text { for all } c \in C
$$

One way to generate it:

-   First, randomize between $p$ and $p^{\prime}$ with weights $\alpha$ and $1-\alpha$.
-   Second, choose a consequence according to whichever lottery came up.

Such a probability distribution over lotteries is called a compound lottery.

In expected utility theory, no distinction between simple and compound lotteries: simple lottery $\alpha p+(1-\alpha) p^{\prime}$ and above compound lottery give same distribution over consequences, so identified with same element of $\boldsymbol{P}$.

So, no problem if DM doesn't know exactly the distribution for something. We'll come back to this.

### The Set Â $P$

As $\alpha p+(1-\alpha) p^{\prime}$ is also a lottery, $P$ is convex.

$P$ is also closed and bounded (why?).

$\Rightarrow P$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, where $n=|C|$.

Whenever $\succsim$ is rational and continuous, can be represented by continuous utility function $U: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ :

$$
p \gtrsim q \Leftrightarrow U(p) \geq U(q)
$$

We're just applying it to lotteries because that's what the DM chooses now.

Intuitively, want more than this.

Want not only that DM has utility function over lotteries, but also that somehow related to "utility" over consequences.

Only care about lotteries insofar as affect distribution over consequences, so preferences over lotteries should have something to do with "preferences" over consequences.

## Expected Utility

Best we could hope for is representation by utility function of following form:

Definition: a utility function $U: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ has an expected utility form if there exists a function $u: C \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that

$$
U(p)=\sum_{c \in C} p(c) u(c) \text { for all } p \in P
$$

In this case, the function $U$ is called an expected utility function, and the function $u$ is call a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function.

If preferences over lotteries happen to have an expected utility representation, it's as if DM has a "utility function" over consequences (and chooses among lotteries so as to maximize expected "utility over consequences").

Remarks

$$
U(p)=\sum_{c \in C} p(c) u(c)
$$

Expected utility function $U: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ represents preferences $\gtrsim$ on $P$ just as we had before

$U: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an example of a standard utility function.

von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function $u: C \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is not a standard utility function.

### Can't have a "real" utility function on consequences, as DM never chooses among consequences.

If preferences over lotteries happen to have an expected utility representation, it's as if DM has a "utility function" over consequences.

This "utility function" over consequences is the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function.

## Example

Suppose hipster restaurant doesn't let you order steak or chicken, but only probability distributions over steak and chicken.

How should you assess menu item ($p(steak)$, $p(chicken)$)?

One way: ask yourself how much you'd like to eat steak, $u(steak)$, and chicken, $u(chicken)$, and evaluate according to

$$
p(\text { steak }) \cdot u(\text { steak })+p(\text { chicken }) \cdot u(\text { chicken })
$$

If this is what you'd do, then your preferences have an expected utility representation.

Suppose instead you choose whichever menu item has $p$ (steak) closest to $\frac{1}{2}$.

Your preferences are rational, so they have a utility representation.

But they do not have an expected utility representation - we'll see this.

## Property of EU: Linearity in Probabilities

::: {#thm-LP}
If $U: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an expected utility function, then

$$
U\left(\alpha p+(1-\alpha) p^{\prime}\right)=\alpha U(p)+(1-\alpha) U\left(p^{\prime}\right)
$$
:::

In fact, a utility function $U: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ has an expected utility form iff this equation holds for all $p, p^{\prime}$, and $\alpha \in[0,1]$.

::: callout-important
## Proof

Appendix.
:::

## Property of EU: Invariant to Affine Transformations

Suppose $U: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an expected utility function representing preferences $\succsim$.

Any increasing transformation of $U$ also represents $\succsim$.

Not all increasing transformations of $U$ have expected utility form.

::: {#thm-IAT}
Suppose $U: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an expected utility function representing preferences $\succsim$. Then $V: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is also an expected utility function representing $\gtrsim$ iff there exist $a, b>0$ such that

$$
V(p)=a+b U(p) \text { for all } p \in P
$$

If this is so, we also have $V(p)=\sum_{c \in C} p(c) v(c)$ for all $p \in P$, where

$$
v(c)=a+b u(c) \text { for all } c \in C
$$

## What Preferences have an Expected Utility Representation?

Preferences must be rational to have any kind of utility representation.

Preferences on a compact and convex set must be continuous to have a continuous utility representation.

Besides rationality and continuity, what's needed to ensure that preferences have an expected utility representation?

## The Independence Axiom

::: {#def-IA}
A preference relation $\gtrsim$ satisfies independence if, for every $p, q, r \in P$ and $\alpha \in(0,1)$,

$$
p \succsim q \Leftrightarrow \alpha p+(1-\alpha) r \succsim \alpha q+(1-\alpha) r
$$
:::

Can interpret as form of "dynamic consistency."

Doesn't need to hold for consequences.

## Back to Example

Suppose choose lottery with $p$ (steak) closest to $\frac{1}{2}$.

Let $p=\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right), q=(0,1), r=(1,0)$, and $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$.

Then

$$
p=\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)>(0,1)=q
$$

but

$$
\alpha q+(1-\alpha) r=\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)>\left(\frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{4}\right)=\alpha p+(1-\alpha) r
$$

Does not satisfy independence.

## Expected Utility: Characterization

A preference relation $\gtrsim$ has an expected utility representation iff it satisfies rationality, continuity, and independence.

Intuition: both having expected utility form and satisfying independence boil down to having straight, parallel indifference curves.

## Subjective Expected Utility Theory

So far, probabilities are objective.

In reality, uncertainty is usually subjective.

Subjective expected utility theory (Savage, 1954): under assumptions roughly similar to ones form this lecture, preferences have an expected utility representation where both the utilities over consequences and the subjective probabilities themselves are revealed by decision-maker's choices.

Thus, expected utility theory applies even when the probabilities are not objectively given.

(To learn more, a good starting point is Kreps (1988), "Notes on the Theory of Choice.")

Again, no problem if DM doesn't know the exact distribution.

The same holds in general equilibrium: allows for different individual priors.

One may go beyond and assume DM has some rule to deal with set of priors - e.g., DM may assume that nature will choose the worst possible prior, conditional on his optimal choice, leading to a mini-max structure that deals with fear of misspecification and relates to sub-rational behavior.

See nice discussion in Hansen and Sargent (2000) and a critique by Sims (AER 2001).

## Attitudes toward Risk

### Money Lotteries

Turn now to special case of choice under uncertainty where outcomes are measured in dollars.

Set of consequences $C$ is subset of $\mathbb{R}$.

A lottery is a cumulative distribution function $F$ on $\mathbb{R}$.

(Now we use $F$ instead of $p$)

Assume preferences have expected utility representation:

$$
U(F) = E_{F}[u(x)] = \int u(x) f(x) d x
$$

More generally, we could write $\int u(x) d F(x)$.

This is useful if we do not know whether a density $f$ exists.

We'll assume it does and make $d F(x) / d x=f(x)$, so that $d F(x)=f(x) d x$, leading to our representation above.

(But everything holds for a general $F(x)$.)

Assume $u$ increasing, differentiable.

Question: how do properties of von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function $u$ relate to decision-maker's attitude toward risk?

## Expected Value vs. Expected Utility

Expected value of lottery $F$ is

$$
E_{F}[x]=\int x f(x) d x
$$

Expected utility of lottery $F$ is

$$
E_{F}[u(x)]=\int u(x) f(x) d x
$$

Can learn about DM's risk attitude by comparing $E_{F}[u(x)]$ and $u\left(E_{F}[x]\right)$.

## Risk Attitude: Definitions

::: {#def-RA}
A decision-maker is risk-averse if she always prefers the sure wealth level $E_{F}[x]$ to the lottery $F$ : that is,

$$
\int u(x) f(x) d x \leq u\left(\int x f(x) d x\right) \text { for all } F
$$

A decision-maker is strictly risk-averse if the inequality is strict for all nondegenerate lotteries $F$.

A decision-maker is risk-neutral if she is always indifferent:

$$
\int u(x) f(x) d x=u\left(\int x f(x) d x\right) \text { for all } F
$$

A decision-maker is risk-loving if she always prefers the lottery:

$$
\int u(x) f(x) d x \geq u\left(\int x f(x) d x\right) \text { for all } F
$$
:::

## Risk Aversion and Concavity

Statement that $\int u(x) d F(x) \leq u\left(\int x d F(x)\right)$ for all $F$ is called Jensen's inequality.

Fact: Jensen's inequality holds iff $u$ is concave.

This implies:

::: {#thm-RA}
A decision-maker is (strictly) risk-averse if and only if $u$ is (strictly) concave.

A decision-maker is risk-neutral if and only if $u$ is linear.

A decision-maker is (strictly) risk-loving if and only if $u$ is (strictly) convex.
:::

## Certainty Equivalents

Can also define risk-aversion using certainty equivalents.

::: {#def-CE}
The certainty equivalent of a lottery $F$ is the sure wealth level that yields the same expected utility as $F$: that is,

$$
u[C E(F, u)] = \int u(x) f(x) d x
$$
:::

That is,

$$
CE(F, u)=u^{-1}\left(\int u(x) d F(x)\right)
$$

::: {#thm-RACE}
A decision-maker is risk-averse iff $C E(F, u) \leq E_{F}(x)$ for all $F$.

A decision-maker is risk-neutral iff $C E(F, u)=E_{F}(x)$ for all $F$.

A decision-maker is risk-loving iff $C E(F, u) \geq E_{F}(x)$ for all $F$.
:::

## Quantifying Risk Attitude

We know what it means for a DM to be risk-averse.

What does it mean for one DM to be more risk-averse than another?

Two possibilities:

-   $u$ is more risk-averse than $v$ if, for every $F, C E(F, u) \leq C E(F, v)$.
-   $u$ is more risk-averse than $v$ if $u$ is "more concave" than $v$, in that $u=g \circ v$ for some increasing, concave $g$.

One more, based on local curvature of utility function: $u$ is more-risk averse than $v$ if, for every $x$,

$$
-\frac{u^{\prime \prime}(x)}{u^{\prime}(x)} \geq-\frac{v^{\prime \prime}(x)}{v^{\prime}(x)}
$$

$A(x, u)=-\frac{u^{\prime \prime}(x)}{u^{\prime}(x)}$ is called the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of absolute risk-aversion.

## An Equivalence

::: {#thm}
The following are equivalent:

-   For every $F$, $CE(F, u) \leq CE(F, v)$.
-   There exists an increasing, concave function $g$ such that $u=g \circ v$.
-   For every $x, A(x, u) \geq A(x, v)$.

## Risk Attitude and Wealth Levels

How does risk attitude vary with wealth?

Natural to assume that a richer individual is more willing to bear risk: whenever a poorer individual is willing to accept a risky gamble, so is a richer individual.

Captured by decreasing absolute risk-aversion:

::: {#def}
A von Neumann-Morenstern utility function $u$ exhibits decreasing (constant, increasing) absolute risk-aversion if $A(x, u)$ is decreasing (constant, increasing) in $x$.
:::

## Risk Attitude and Wealth Levels

::: {#thm-RAWL}
Suppose $u$ exhibits decreasing absolute risk-aversion.

If the decision-maker accepts some gamble at a lower wealth level, she also accepts it at any higher wealth level:

that is, for any lottery $F(x)$, if

$$
E_{F}[u(w+x)] \geq u(w)
$$

then, for any $w^{\prime}>w$,

$$
E_{F}\left[u\left(w^{\prime}+x\right)\right] \geq u\left(w^{\prime}\right)
$$
:::

## Multiplicative Gambles

What about gambles that multiply wealth, like choosing how risky a stock portfolio to hold? Are richer individuals also more willing to bear multiplicative risk? Depends on increasing/decreasing relative risk-aversion:

$$
R(x, u)=-\frac{u^{\prime \prime}(x)}{u^{\prime}(x)} x
$$

::: {#thm}
Suppose u exhibits decreasing relative risk-aversion.

If the decision-maker accepts some multiplicative gamble at a lower wealth level, she also accepts it at any higher wealth level: that is, for any lottery $F(t)$, if

$$
E_{F}[u(t w)] \geq u(w)
$$

then, for any $w^{\prime}>w$,

Relative Risk-Aversion vs. Absolute Risk-Aversion

$$
R(x)=x A(x)
$$

decreasing relative risk-aversion $\Rightarrow$ decreasing absolute risk-aversion

increasing absolute risk-aversion $\Rightarrow$ increasing relative risk-aversion
:::

Ex. decreasing relative risk-aversion $\Rightarrow$ more willing to gamble $1 \%$ of wealth as get richer.

So certainly more willing to gamble a fixed amount of money.

## Application: Insurance

Risk-averse agent with wealth $w$, faces probability $p$ of incurring monetary $loss L$.

Can insure against the loss by buying a policy that pays out $a$ if the loss occurs.

Policy that pays out a costs qa.

How much insurance should she buy?

## Agent's Problem

$$
\max_{a} p u(w-q a-L+a)+(1-p) u(w-q a)
$$

$u$ concave $\Rightarrow$ concave problem, so FOC is necessary and sufficient.

FOC:

$$
p(1-q) u^{\prime}(w-q a-L+a)=(1-p) q u^{\prime}(w-q a)
$$

Equate marginal benefit of extra dollar in each state.

## Actuarily Fair Prices

Insurance is actuarily fair if expected payout qa equals cost of insurance $p a$ : that is, $p=q$.

With acturarily fair insurance, FOC becomes

$$
u^{\prime}(w-q a-L+a)=u^{\prime}(w-q a)
$$

Solution: $a=L$

A risk-averse DM facing actuarily fair prices will always fully insure.

## Actuarily Unfair Prices

What if insurance company makes a profit, so $q>p$ ?

Rearrange FOC as

$$
\frac{u^{\prime}(w-q a-L+a)}{u^{\prime}(w-q a)}=\frac{(1-p) q}{p(1-q)}>1
$$

Solution: $a<L$

A risk-averse DM facing actuarily unfair prices will never fully insure.

Intuition: $u$ approximately linear for small risks, so not worth giving up expected value to insure away last little bit of variance.

## Comparative Statics

$$
\max _{a} p u(w-q a-L+a)+(1-p) u(w-q a)
$$

Bigger loss $\Rightarrow$ buy more insurance ( $a^{*}$ increasing in $L$ ) Follows from Topkis' theorem.

If agent has decreasing absolute risk-aversion, then she buys less insurance as she gets richer.

Prove it as an exercise!

## Application: Portfolio Choice

Risk-averse agent with wealth $w$ has to invest in a safe asset and a risky asset.

Safe asset pays certain return $r$.

Risky asset pays random return $z$, with $\operatorname{cdf} F$.

Agent's problem

$$
\max _{a \in[0, w]} \int u(a z+(w-a) r) d F(z)
$$

First-order condition

$$
\int(z-r) u^{\prime}(a z+(w-a) r) d F(z)=0
$$

## Risk-Neutral Benchmark

Suppose $u^{\prime}(x)=\alpha x$ for some $\alpha>0$.

Then

$$
U(a)=\int \alpha(a z+(w-a) r) d F(z)
$$

so

$$
U^{\prime}(a)=\alpha(E[z]-r)
$$

Solution: set $a=w$ if $E[z]>r$, set $a=0$ if $E[z]<r$.

Risk-neutral investor puts all wealth in the asset with the highest rate of return.

$r>E[z]$ Benchmark

$$
U^{\prime}(0)=\int(z-r) u^{\prime}(w) d F=(E[z]-r) u^{\prime}(w)
$$

If safe asset has higher rate of return, then even risk-averse investor puts all wealth in the safe asset.

## More Interesting Case

What if agent is risk-averse, but risky asset has higher expected return?

$$
U^{\prime}(0)=(E[z]-r) u^{\prime}(w)>0
$$

If risky asset has higher rate of return, then risk-averse investor always puts some wealth in the risky asset.

## Comparative Statics

Does a less risk-averse agent always invest more in the risky asset?

Sufficient condition for agent $v$ to invest more than agent $u$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
\int(z-r) u^{\prime}(a z+(w-a) r) d F=0 \\
\Rightarrow \int(z-r) v^{\prime}(a z+(w-a) r) d F \geq 0
\end{gathered}
$$

$u$ more risk-averse $\Rightarrow v=h \circ u$ for some increasing, convex $h$. Inequality equals

$$
\int(z-r) h^{\prime}(u(a z+(w-a) r)) u^{\prime}(a z+(w-a) r) d F \geq 0
$$

$h^{\prime}(\cdot)$ positive and increasing in $z$

$\Rightarrow$ multiplying by $h^{\prime}(\cdot)$ puts more weight on positive $(z>r)$ terms, less weight on negative terms.

A less risk-averse agent always invests more in the risky-asset.
